# August 5th: Made the USB-C Input and Voltage regulator!

Did a research on ESP32 S3 boards looked out ESP32 S3 Devkit and it's [schematic](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/SCH_ESP32-S3-DEVKITC-1_V1_20210312C.pdf) to learn about the wiring and made my own USB-C input and a voltage regulator to step down voltage from 5V to 3.3V for safer operation of the chip.
